Quick Start
Overview

This repository currently runs two versions in parallel: the original notebooks + frontend, and a new modular backend + frontend.
The modular backend lives under /src with four packages: eda, original, task2, and common. The workflow has been verified to run end-to-end from a single ZIP input.

Repository layout (relevant parts)

src/ – backend modules (eda, original, task2, common).

tools/ – three command-line scripts used to produce backend artifacts.

reports/… – outputs (e.g., default points_all.csv under reports/task1/original).

Prerequisites

A Python environment with the required packages activated locally (conda/venv acceptable).

Example
# Conda
conda activate geo-cu

# Or venv (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

End-to-End backend run (before starting the frontend)

Execute the following in PowerShell from the repository root:

Run EDA / ingestion

'python tools\run_eda.py'


(Processes the ZIP input and writes the cleaned CSVs; see console summary.)

Build unified points dataset

'python tools\build_points_all_v2.py'


If your branch still has build_points_all.py, use that filename instead; both serve the same purpose of generating points_all.*.

Recompute Task-2 artifacts

'python tools\recompute_task2.py'


(Runs the Task-2 overlap pipeline and prints produced files.)

Launch the frontend

After the backend completes, start the app with:

'streamlit run start.py'
