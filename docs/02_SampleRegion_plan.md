# Task 2: Sample Region Analysis Plan

## Version & Update Log
- v1.0 | 2025-08-09 | Initial draft

## Objectives
- Select a spatially representative subset of the dataset
- Test analytical methods on a manageable scale
- Compare original and DL datasets in detail

## Subtasks
1. Region Selection
   - Choose based on data density and relevance
   - Document selection criteria

2. Data Interpolation
   - Apply 2D and 3D interpolation for both datasets
   - Select interpolation method (e.g., IDW, Kriging)

3. Comparison Metrics
   - Absolute and relative differences in Cu_ppm
   - RMSE, MAE, KS test, Cliffâ€™s delta

4. Visualisation
   - 2D heatmaps and difference maps
   - 3D isosurfaces, slices, and profiles

## Deliverables
- Comparison figures and metrics
- Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/`
- Summary in `reports/`
