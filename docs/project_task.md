# Project Tasks Overview

## Version & Update Log
- v1.0 | 2025-08-09 | Initial draft

## Task 1: Data Preparation & EDA
Goal: Build a clear understanding of the dataset and ensure data is clean and consistent for analysis.

Main Work:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and validation
- Descriptive statistics
- Initial spatial and depth-based visualisation

Outputs:
- Cleaned datasets
- Basic plots and summary
- Jupyter notebooks for EDA

## Task 2: Sample Region Analysis
Goal: Select a representative region for deeper comparison between original and DL datasets.

Main Work:
- Region selection based on spatial coverage and density
- 2D/3D interpolation of both datasets
- Difference metrics and statistical comparison
- Visualisation in 2D and 3D

Outputs:
- Comparison maps and metrics
- Reusable analysis scripts

## Task 3: Interactive Platform Prototype
Goal: Develop a basic Streamlit-based tool for interactive exploration.

Main Work:
- UI setup and basic navigation
- Layer switching (original vs DL)
- Depth and Cu filters
- Combined 2D and 3D visualisation

Outputs:
- Prototype app
- Short user guide

## Task 4: Scaling to Full Dataset
Goal: Apply analysis pipeline to the entire dataset and integrate results into the platform.

Main Work:
- Spatial subdivision
- Batch processing and visualisation
- Platform feature extension

Outputs:
